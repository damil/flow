"Psylloidea database","Psyl'list","2","15-12-2015","Ouvrard David","Animalia",,"Psyl'list is an online database dedicated to Jumping Plant-Lice (Insecta, Hemiptera, Psylloidea). The aim of this ongoing project is primarily to make up the absence of world catalogues for Psylloidea, in organizing taxonomic data and providing easy access to the published taxonomic data already available, but scattered in literature. In the future, information about Psylloidea morphology, host-plants and biogeography, as well as linked molecular data, will be added.","MNHN","http://hemiptera-databases.org/psyllist/","Global",75,4,"http://hemiptera.infosyslab.fr/explorerdocs/psyllogo.tif","ouvrard@mnhn.fr"
