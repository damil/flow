"Tessaratomidae Database","","1","01/08/2013","Magnien Philippe","Animalia","","The objective of this site is to build an illustrated catalog of the World Tessaratomidae. It will take some time, as the author has not seen all species in this family, not yet photographed all the bugs he has seen, and more is not sure, for half of them, of the species they belong to. It will evolve with the knowledge of the author, so any contribution is welcome (bugs, pictures, identification).","","http://hemiptera-databases.com/tessaratomidae/","Global","85","4","",""
